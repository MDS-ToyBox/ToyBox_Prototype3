As the character moves using mouse, keyboard, controller or virtual joystick on a touch device, the camera follows the character, observing from an over-the-shoulder point of view. This perspective emphasizes the main character and is popular in action and adventure games. The example map in the pack contains a several objects that the player can jump upon and a ramp the player can walk up.\n"
